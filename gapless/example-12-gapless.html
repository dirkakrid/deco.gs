<h1>FAQ</h1>
<dl>
	<dt>Which browsers does the Deco Grid System work in?</dt>
	<dd>All browsers as far back as (and including!) Internet Explorer 6, 
		without any wrapping, cropping, or other bad behaviour. It's rock solid.
		It may work in older browsers, but we haven't tested this.</dd>
	<dt>Does it work with both fixed and fluid layouts?</dt>
	<dd>Absolutely!</dd>
	<dt>Can I nest grids inside grids?</dt>
	<dd>Yup, it works fine, but make sure you understand good layout principles, 
		so you don't ruin your layout by breaking the invisible grid too often.</dd>
	<dt>What's with the <code>\3a</code> notation for the <code>w1:2</code> etc. classes?</dt>
	<dd>It's a workaround notation since Internet Explorer 6 (and 7, possibly) doesn't support
		the plain backslash escape for class names with colon in them. 
		You can of course rename this if you think it's ugly. 
		We think it's easier to think of three quarters as <code>3:4</code>.</dd>
	<dt>Isn't the use of dedicated divs for layout semantic noise? 
		Aren't you just reinventing tables using divs?</dt>
	<dd>First of all, HTML (with some exceptions like the <code>&lt;address&gt;</code> tag)
		isn't really semantic, it's <em>structural</em>. 
		You can of course argue this until the cows come home, but the main thing 
		to keep in mind is that screen readers — which are the closest we get to semantics today — 
		have no issue with using divs like this and compared to the workarounds other 
		layouts need, we think you'll find this approach simple and refreshing.</dd>
	<dd>The whole point of not using tables for layout is that devices such as screen readers will
		interpret them as <em>data tables</em>, which they are not. They swiftly skip over any divs.
		This is why divs exist in the first place — a semantics-free tag to group things with.</dd>
	<dd>Also, it frees us up to put the content 
		in a meaningful order, and makes it easier to add support for things like
		mobile devices.</dd>
	<dd>And, nobody reads class names and expect them to make sense. No, really. ;-)
		</dd>
	<dt>What is the size of the Deco Grid system?</dt>
	<dd>The baseline functionality is two classes (!), plus 16 convenience classes each for position and width. 
		After using the YUI CSS compressor, it's <em>714 or 907 bytes</em>, for the 12- and 16-column versions, respectively.</dd>
	<dt>How is the Deco Grid System different from other grid frameworks like Blueprint, 960 Grids, and others?</dt>
	<dd>As we already mentioned, it's smaller. A lot smaller. Less than 1K — vs. 11K (Blueprint), 5.4K (960 Grids), etc.
		We realize that this size comparison isn't entirely fair, since they include lots of non-grid stuff, 
		but even when you strip their files of all that, we're smaller.</dd>
	<dd>We believe Deco Grids a lot simpler to understand and use, the naming convention and mental model 
		is very very simple, and it arguably degrades better.</dd>
	<dd>It doesn't ship with anything outside of the grid system — font choices, form builders, other unrelated CSS. 
		It's built to drop right into your existing CSS code with a minimum amount of fuss.</dd>
	<dd>It's really well-suited for automated layout algorithms for CMSes and other web apps.</dd>
	<dd>It doesn't assume that you always work in pixel-based layouts, like a lot of other frameworks do.</dd>
	<dd>It doesn't need any workarounds/hacks to work reliably in all browsers.</dd>
	<dt>Anything else I need to know?</dt>
	<dd>Never try to combine stuff into the divs that govern the layout. 
		Create your own elements inside instead. This makes things much easier and
		very reliable and predictable.</dd>
